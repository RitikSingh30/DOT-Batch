    <h2>Love Story</h2>
    <p>The Love Story begin from 2nd December 2022 (night)üíù. Both the love birds saw each other on the stage for the first time, there were no talks between them at the moment of time after few hours first time they talk to each other and the first few words from the girl side was <strong>"Akhir aapne jiju ke shoe pehele hi chupa diya na"</strong> then he replyed with a smile <strong>"Maine kuch nahi kiya"</strong>. Then the whole night they didn't talk to each other, only they were seeing to one another. In the next morning the girl was sitting alone in the room, the boy thought to tell here what is there in his heart so he entered in the room but due to some unexcepted reason he was not able to talk here properly, again the whole day was wastedüòî. At night he took courage and thought that this is the rigth time to ask here. But again the result was not in his favourüíî. Next morning the boy was about to leave but before leaving he though let's give one more chance and he went to that girl and asked her for a phone number, the girl gave her phone number and the boy happly went away. They chatted on whatsapp for some time, On 5th December he asked her can we have a phone call the girl agreed, The first word the girl spoken was <strong>"Pehchan liya ya Naam batau"</strong>and he smile and reply <strong>"Pehchan liya"</strong>üòÖ Then boy asked the girl "Mujse shadi karogi"üíò she replyed with a smile <strong>"Agar papaji ready hai to mujhe koi problem nahi hai"</strong>‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π And This was the begining of there Love Story!!!</p>
